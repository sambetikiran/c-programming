```
## 1.Explain the concept of process creation in operating systems.
```
A.process creation is while execution process will be created.
In process we can create multiple process based on our requirments.
Each process will have separate pid and the relation between those process will be parent child relation.
```
## 2.Differentiate between the fork() and exec() system calls.
```
fork():
by using fork() we can create a child process for parent process.
exec():
By using exec()  will useful to replace the process image with new program or new memory.
```
## 3.Write a C program to demonstrate the use of fork() system call. 
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<unistd.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
int main()
{
        int id;
        id=fork();
        if(id==0)
        {
                printf("child process\n");
        }
        else
        {
                printf("parent process\n");
        }
}
```
## 4.What is the purpose of the wait() system call in process management?
```
wait () system call is a blocking call  this wait system call will wait for the child process termination and exit status 
in process management.
```
## 5.Describe the role of the exec() family of functions in process management.
```
exec() family are 5 things
1.execl()
2.execv()
3.execlp()
4.execvp()
5.execve()
With this exec families will used to replace the new process image with new program
and in child process if we perform exec() function it will execute from the new process.
```
## 6.Write a C program to illustrate the use of the execvp() function.
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<unistd.h>
#include<sys/wait.h>
int main()
{
        int status;
        char *args[4];
        args[0]="ls";
        args[1]=NULL;
        int pid=fork();
        if(pid==0)
        {
                execvp("ls",args);
                exit(5);
        }
        else
        {
                printf("parent process");
        }
        wait(&status);
}
```
## 7.How does the vfork() system call differ from fork()? 
```
fork() is a system call which will copy parent process to child process with separate memory space or physical frame in memory.
vfork() is a system call  which will share the parent memory space or physical frame in memory with child until exec() or exit ()call happen.
```
## 8.Discuss the significance of the getpid() and getppid() system calls.
```
getpid() is used to return the child process pid
getppid() is used to return the child's parent process pid .
```
## 9
## 10.Write a program in C to create a child process using fork() and print its PID. 
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<unistd.h>
int main()
{
        int id=fork();
        if(id==0)
        {
                printf("child process=%d\n",getpid());
        }
        else
        {
                printf("parent process=%d\n",getpid());
        }
}
```
## 11.Describe the process hierarchy in UNIX-like operating systems. 
```
process will set in execution.
Every first process called parent process will have ppid is init_->1.
In these we can have multiple process parent and child process we can create 1 or more child process.
Orphan process is the process that its parent  process will executed before child process and its ppid will be init_ called orphan process.
zombie process is the process that child process will executed and parent process will not collect the status from child using wait() system call
call zombie process.
```
## 12.Describe the process hierarchy in UNIX-like operating systems.
```
the purpose of exit() system call is to terminate the particular child process and
send its status to the parent process.
```
## 13.Discuss the role of the fork() system call in implementing multitasking.
```
fork() system call used to create new process of duplicate of its parent process
we can create mutliple child process and we can do mutliple tasks assign to the particular child process
```
## 14. Write a C program to create multiple child processes using fork() and display their PIDs.
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<unistd.h>
#include<sys/wait.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
int main()
{
        int status;
        int pid1=fork();
        if(pid1==0)
        {
                printf("%d child process pid\n",getpid());
                exit(0);
        }
        int pid2=fork();
        if(pid2==0)
        {
                printf("%d child process pid\n",getpid());
                exit(0);
        }
        waitpid(pid1,&status,0);
        waitpid(pid2,&status,0);
}
```
## 15.How does the exec() system call replace the current process image with a new one?
```
exec() system call will replace the current process with new program.
if we do in child process that current process imaage run untitl it meets exec call
when exec call meets it will perform command line arguments of perticular location it will moved
example: my file name is a.out and exec has ls -l command
if i call exec in the program it will replace the ls -l memory space with a.out
and it will perform the ls -l it will not perform the a.out.
```
## 16. Explain the concept of process scheduling in operating systems. 
```
process sheduling are there in kernal space in operating system.
it will work with process control management(PCB) it will control the pcb which pcb wanted to perform first.
```
## 17. Write a program in C to create a zombie process and explain how to avoid it.
```c#include<stdio.h>
#include<unistd.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
int main()
{
        int stats;
        int pid=fork();
        if(pid==0)
        {
                printf("child process=%d",getpid());
                exit(5);
        }
        printf("parent process=%d",getpid());
        sleep(10);
}
To avoid zombie process we have to check the program whether the parent is collecting the exit status of child process or not using wait blocking call
```
## 22.Write a C program to demonstrate the use of the waitpid() function for process synchronization.
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<sys/wait.h>
#include<unistd.h>
int main()
{
        int stats;
        int pid=fork();
        if(pid==0)
        {
                printf("child process\n");
                sleep(3);
                exit(5);
        }
        else
        {
                int wpid=waitpid(pid,&stats,0);
                printf("parent process\n");
                if(wpid<0)
                {
                        printf("%d",wpid);
                        exit(0);
                }
                printf("pid will be %d\n",WEXITSTATUS(stats));
        }
}
```
## 23. Discuss the role of the execle() function in the exec() family of call
```
execle() is a function in the exec() family that replaces the current process image with a new program, passing a list of arguments and a custom environment for the new program.
Unlike execl(), it allows the caller to specify environment variables explicitly instead of inheriting the parentâ€™s environment.
```
## 26.discuss the role of getpid and getppid()
```
getpid is used to get the pid number of the process.
getppid is used to get the ppid number of the particular child process.
```
## 27. Difference between fork() and clone()
```
fork(): Creates a new process (child) with a separate address space. Uses copy-on-write (COW) for memory.
clone(): More flexible, allows fine-grained sharing (files, memory, signal handlers). Used internally by pthread_create().
```
## 28. Write a C program to demonstrate the use of the system() function for executing shell commands. 
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<unistd.h>
#include<sys/wait.h>
int main()
{
        printf("enter the command of 'ls -l' ");
        int ret=system("ls -l");
        if(ret<0)
        {
                printf("error\n");
        }
        else
        {
                printf("command executed within the value %d\n",ret);
        }
}
```
## 29. Explain the concept of process states in UNIX-like operating systems.
```
the process is a program in execution is called process
they are some states they are:
1.creating process- process is creating using fork()
2.runable-process is loaded in memory(a.out) waiting for CPU to execute based on schedular
3.running- process is executed in CPU.
4.waiting/blocked- process executing in the events in the process
5.terminated- using exit/ wait termination status will get or zombie process will occur
6. suspended- it means the process that will stop or suspended due to invalid behaviour of program.
```
## 31. Discuss the role of the execv() function in the exec() family of calls. 
```
the role of execv() is when execfamily call the current image process will replace with new  image process
and these will have three argumnets address of the file,and array of character pointers will there
```
## 33. Significance of PIDs
```
Unique identifier for processes. Used in signals, scheduling, process groups, monitoring.
```
## 34. what is orphan process
```
it is the process that parent process is terminated beofre the child process is called orphan process.
```
## 36. Describe the concept of process priority and how it is managed in operating systems.
```
the priority process will determines the CPU time of particular process.
based on the CPU time it will give high priority process will be performed 
```
## 37. Explain the purpose of the fork() system call in creating copy-on-write (COW) processes.
```
In this child is initially created in parent process memory after it will copy to as different memory
it will help to improve the performance
```
## 40. Explain the concept of process context switching and its impact on system performance. 
```
In sheduling method when CPU time completed before the process completely executing then it will go to another process that process of switiching is called context switching
```
## 41.Role of clone() System Call in Creating Threads in Linux
```
The clone() system call in Linux is a low-level system call used to create a new process or thread.
It is more flexible than fork() because it allows the parent process to specify which resources are shared between the parent and child.
```
## 43. Explain the difference between process creation using fork() and pthread_create(). 
```
fork() system call used to create a child process with separate memory
in pthread_create() used to create a new thread with same or shared memory.
```
