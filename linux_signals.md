Sure üëç here are the answers rewritten in short paragraph form (1‚Äì2 lines each):
**1.**
Signals are asynchronous notifications sent to a process to inform it of events such as interrupts or exceptions. In Unix-like systems, they are used to handle events like `Ctrl+C` (SIGINT) or illegal operations without continuous polling.

**2.**
Hardware interrupts come from external devices like keyboards or timers, while software interrupts are generated by programs or system calls. Problems like race conditions, lost interrupts, or priority inversion may occur if not handled properly.

**3.**
Synchronous signals occur due to a process‚Äôs own actions (like division by zero), whereas asynchronous signals come from external sources such as other processes. A process can use both by registering handlers for external signals and letting the kernel deliver internal ones.

**4.**
Signals can be generated by the kernel (for errors like segmentation faults), other processes (using the `kill()` system call), or hardware/terminal input (like pressing `Ctrl+C`).

**5.**
A signal handler is a user-defined function that executes when a signal is received, allowing a process to take custom actions instead of following the default behavior like termination or ignoring the signal.

**6.**
The `kill(pid, signal)` system call is used to send signals to a specific process, while `raise(signal)` can send a signal to the calling process itself.

**7.**
A process can send a signal to itself using the `raise()` function, for example:

```c
raise(SIGUSR1);
```

This sends the SIGUSR1 signal to the same process.

**8.**
The default action of `SIGKILL` is to immediately and unconditionally terminate a process; it cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored by the process.

**9.**
When a process is in kernel mode, signals are held pending and delivered only after returning to user mode to ensure kernel operations are not interrupted.

**10.**
When a process receives a `SIGSEGV` signal due to invalid memory access, it terminates by default and may produce a core dump unless a custom handler is defined.

Would you like me to convert these into a **short interview notes sheet** format (like Q‚ÄìA side-by-side, easy to memorize)?
